# MUNSA Parley#
### A simple, web based solution to chairing a room ###

Parley is a room timer for Model U.N. and other events that are organized around Robert's Rules of Order.  While currently in alpha, a final version should be useful using styling from [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) and autocomplete from [Typeahead](http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/).  Feel free to use this in other conferences, as long as attribution is given.
