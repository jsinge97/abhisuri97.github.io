I am a very responsible and loyal to any organization I am apart of; I will honor any commitment I make. For example: I attended the Tech City, USA radio show as a guest to promote the School's Out Hackathon even though I had arrived very late at night from another country. Since I have an adequate standing within my school, I am able to publicize any Apps for Aptitude project and motivate other students to become involved. In addition, I represent the minority because of my hispanic heritage. Since I am bilingual, hispanic and a female, I am able to communicate AFA's projects to a larger audience and convince other young girls to become more involved with computer programming. Also, I have excellent public speaking skills and interpersonal skills. I have presented projects in front of a large audience at places such as the Texas Capitol and Trinity University; I have represented AFA in a professional manner as well when I traveled to Washington, D.C to speak on behalf of AFA at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. My networking skills are very adequate; I am able to communicate with a large and varied audience and convey information in an intellectual and passionate way which enables me to capture their attention and make a considerable impression. \\r\\n\",\"type\":\"para\",\"validation\":\"\",\"required\":\"1\",\"min\":\"0\",\"max\":\"100000\",\"tooltip\":\"field5\",\"custom\":null,\"custom2\":null},\"9\":{\"label\":\"Short+Answer+2%3A\",\"value\":\"I have connections with Loft Innovation (Eutiquio Chapa) and the Hispanic Heritage Foundation (Belen Marquina). \\r\\n\",\"type\":\"para\",\"validation\":\"\",\"required\":\"1\",\"min\":\"0\",\"max\":\"100000\",\"tooltip\":\"field6\",\"custom\":null,\"custom2\":null},\"10\":{\"label\":\"Skills\",\"value\":\"First off, I am an extremely hard worker. This past year I enrolled in five AP classes, played varsity volleyball, and participated in Model United Nations San Antonio. Not only did I do will in my extracurricular activities, but I scored very well on all five of my AP exams. However, my success was not attributed to intelligence but to the dedication and hard work I put in towards studying. While working in groups, I am the member who will ensure our end product is adequate and complete any aspect that is incomplete. Although I would not consider myself an adequate hacker, I have taken the initiative to learn coding. I find coding very interesting, and I am motivated to learn more about it. Since I partook in many activities and challenging classes this past year, I made it my priority to perfect my time management skills so that I could complete each task thoroughly and efficiently. My time management and organizational skills have allowed my to obtain the position of Event Coordinator on the Model United Nation San Antonio Secretariat. The application process was very competitive and showed that I possess the necessary qualities to fulfill the role with the most responsibility and work. I am one of the most important members on the team because I communicate with our venue and hotel representatives to ensure all delegates arrive smoothly. Although these qualities are often overlooked, I am also a very positive and motivated person. I make an excellent group member because I am able to work with any type of personality and come prepared every day with a positive attitude. Lastly, I am an assertive person. It is necessary for any successful organization to have members that are assertive individuals who are unafraid to make connections. For example: In Washington, D.C, I was the youngest fellow out of the group but my age did not hinder me from making connections with the CEO of the Entertainment Software Association and the Director of E3. Another time I took the initiative to make connections with Bill Powers, President of the University of Texas at Austin, Congressmen Henry Cuellar and Joaquin Castro, and Senator Bill Bradley. \",\"type\":\"para\",\"validation\":\"\",\"required\":\"1\",\"min\":\"0\",\"max\":\"100000\",\"tooltip\":\"field7\",\"custom\":null,\"custom2\":null},\"11\":{\"label\":\"Resume\",\"value\":\"1\",\"type\":\"upload\",\"validation\":\"file\",\"required\":\"1\",\"min\":\"\",\"max\":\"\",\"tooltip\":\"field8\",\"custom\":null,\"custom2\":null},\"12\":{\"label\":\"files\",\"value\":\"http:\\\/\\\/appsforaptitude.org\\\/nforms\\\/file-upload\\\/server\\\/php\\\/files\\\/2015.MiaBenavidez.Resume%20%284%29.pdf\",\"type\":\"file0\",\"validation\":null,\"required\":null,\"min\":null,\"max\":null,\"tooltip\":null,\"custom\":null,\"custom2\":null},\"13\":{\"label\":\"Drug+Use\",\"value\":\"No\",\"type\":\"radio\",\"validation\":\"\",\"required\":\"1\",\"min\":\"\",\"max\":\"\",\"tooltip\":\"field9\",\"custom\":null,\"custom2\":null},\"14\":{\"label\":\"Alcohol+Use\",\"value\":\"No\",\"type\":\"radio\",\"validation\":\"\",\"required\":\"1\",\"min\":\"\",\"max\":\"\",\"tooltip\":\"field10\",\"custom\":null,\"custom2\":null},\"15\":{\"label\":\"Previous+Performance\",\"value\":\"I obtained two $1,000 grants (Awesome Foundation and Loft Innovation), sent out numerous emails to individuals interested in writing about organization similar to AFA, attended Washington, D.C and professionally represented Apps for Aptitude while speaking on a panel at the Eisenhower Executive Building, and appeared as a guest on Tech City, USA in order to promote the School\\u2019s Out Hackathon.
